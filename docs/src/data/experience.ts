      "Me desempeñé en la corrección y resolución de bugs dentro de un software de presupuestos desarrollado bajo una arquitectura monolítica en Django. Implementé la comunicación entre el frontend y el backend mediante JavaScript y AJAX, garantizando la correcta interacción con las vistas y modelos definidos en el framework. La lógica de negocio se gestionaba directamente en las views y modelos de Django, mientras que la interfaz de usuario se construía a través del sistema de templates, asegurando una integración coherente entre las capas de la aplicación.",

      "Regarding university projects, various applications were developed using the technologies mentioned below. Among them, a carbon footprint calculator stands out, implemented using a microservices architecture, which allowed for the practical application of the knowledge acquired during my studies. A web portfolio was also developed, along with other projects, all of which are documented in the GitHub repository. It should be noted that, as these were academic projects, not all of them were deployed in production environments.",
